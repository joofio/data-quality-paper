\begin{abstract}
  \textbf{Background:} The increasing prevalence of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in healthcare systems globally has underscored the importance of data quality for clinical decision-making and research, particularly in obstetrics. High-quality data is vital for an accurate representation of patient populations and to avoid erroneous healthcare decisions. However, existing studies have highlighted significant challenges in EHR data quality, necessitating innovative tools and methodologies for effective data quality assessment and improvement.

  \textbf{Objective:} This paper addresses the critical need for reliable data quality evaluation in obstetrics by developing a novel tool. The tool utilizes Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) standards in conjunction with Bayesian Networks and expert rules, offering a comprehensive approach to assessing data quality in real-world obstetrics data.
  
  \textbf{Methods:} A harmonized framework focusing on Completeness, Plausibility, and Conformance underpins our methodology. We employed Bayesian networks for advanced probabilistic modeling, integrated outlier detection methods, and a rule-based system grounded in domain-specific knowledge. The development and validation of the tool were based on obstetrics data from nine Portuguese hospitals, spanning the years 2019 to 2020.
  
  \textbf{Results:} The developed tool demonstrated strong potential for identifying data quality issues in obstetrics EHRs. Bayesian networks used in the tool showed high performance for various features. Preliminary evaluations can reach AUROC of as high as 88\%. The tool's infrastructure and interoperable format as a FHIR API enables a possible deployment of a real-time data quality assessment in obstetrics settings. 
  
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study contributes significantly to the field of EHR data quality assessment, with a specific focus on obstetrics. The combination of HL7-FHIR interoperability, machine learning techniques, and expert knowledge presents a robust, adaptable solution to the challenges of healthcare data quality. Future research should explore tailored data quality evaluations for different healthcare contexts, as well as further validation of the tool capabilities, enhancing the tool's utility across diverse medical domains.
